# Solutions for  "The C Programming Language 2nd edition"

![book](Images/book.jpg)

## Prologue

I just started to get acquainted with the C language from this book, so the solutions may not be 
clean. 

As I go through the chapters of the book, I will not rewrite the codes so that the reader and I have more or less the same knowledge.

All codes are in folder **"Solutions"**, notes are in folder **"Notes"**. Some notes are written in Russian language, so just translate it ;)

If you find bugs, I will be glad to get acquainted with them.
