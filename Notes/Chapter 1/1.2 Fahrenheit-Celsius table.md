```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */

int main() {
    int fahr;
    int celsius;
    int lower;
    int upper;
    int step;

    lower = 0;  // lower limit of temperature table
    upper = 300;
    step = 20;

    fahr = lower;
    while (fahr <= upper) {
        celsius = 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9;
        printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
        fahr = fahr + step;
    }
}
```

The two lines
```c
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
	for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */
```
are a comment, which in this case explains briefly what the program does. Any characters between "/*" and "*/" are ignored by the compiler; they may be used freely to make a program easier to understand. Comments may appear anywhere a blank or tab or newline can.

C provides several other basic data types besides **int** and **float**, including:

char - character-a single byte
short - short integer
long - long integer
double - double-precision floating point


```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */

int main() {
    float fahr;
    float celsius;
    int lower;
    int upper;
    int step;

    lower = 0;    // lower limit of temperature table
    upper = 300;  // upper limit
    step = 20;    // step size

    fahr = lower;
    while (fahr <= upper) {
        celsius = (5.0 / 9.0) * (fahr - 32.0);
        printf("%3.0f\t%6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
        fahr = fahr + step;
    }
}

```

The **printf** conversion specification %3.0f says that a floating-point number (here **fahr**) is to be printed at least three characters wide, with no decimal point and no fraction digits. %6.1f describes another number (celsius) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. The output looks like this:

>   0  -  -17.8
>  20  -  -4.4
>  40  -   4.4

Width and precision may be omitted from a specification: %6f says that the number is to be at least six characters wide; %.2f specifies two characters after the decimal point, but the width is not constrained; and %f merely says to print the number as floating point.

> %d.   -    print as decimal integer
> %6d  -   print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide
> %f    -    print as floating point
> %6f   -   print as floating point, at least 6 characters wide
> %.2f   -   print as floating point, 2 characters after decimal point
> %6.2f  -  print as floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point

Among others, printf also recognizes %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal, %c for character, %s for character string, and "%%(%%)" for "%" itself.

## Exercise 1-3

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */

int main() {
    float fahr;
    float celsius;
    int lower;
    int upper;
    int step;

    lower = 0;    // lower limit of temperature table
    upper = 300;  // upper limit
    step = 20;    // step size

    fahr = lower;

    printf("Fahrenheit-Celsius table\n\n");

    while (fahr <= upper) {
        celsius = (5.0 / 9.0) * (fahr - 32.0);
        printf("%3.0f\t%6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
        fahr = fahr + step;
    }
}
```


## Exercise 1-4

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float fahr;
    float celcius;
    int lower;
    int upper;
    int step;

    lower = 0;
    upper = 300;
    step = 20;

    celcius = lower;

    printf("Celcuis-Fahrenheir table\n\n");

    while (celcius <= upper) {
        fahr = (9.0 * celcius / 5.0) + 32.0;
        printf("%3.0f\t%6.1f\n", celcius, fahr);
        celcius = celcius + step;
    }
}
```
